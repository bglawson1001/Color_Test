|   #   | File     | Description                      |
| :---: | -------- | -------------------------------- |
|   1   | [main.go](https://github.com/bglawson1001/Color_Test/blob/main/main.go) | Main driver of this program, running this will create the various images. |
|   2   | [gray_image.png](https://github.com/bglawson1001/Color_Test/blob/main/gray_image.png) | Gray version of the image I used for this program.
|   3   | [downloaded_image.png](https://github.com/bglawson1001/Color_Test/blob/main/downloaded_image.jpg) | Original image I used for this program.
|   4   | [Color_Wheel.png](https://github.com/bglawson1001/img_module/blob/main/grayscale.go) | Text that says Color_Wheel this was supposed to be the output of my program however it prints hello world instead by mistake. 
|   5   | [hello.png](https://github.com/bglawson1001/Color_Test/blob/main/hello.png) | This is the result of my color text function, also in my program it opens the image as a jpg, but dragging it here made it into a png.
|   6   | [go.sum](https://github.com/bglawson1001/Color_Test/blob/main/go.sum) | This file maintains the checksum so when the program runs again it will not reinstall the packages, and instead use the cache.
|   7  | [go.mod](https://github.com/bglawson1001/Color_Test/blob/main/go.mod) | This file is necessary because it declares the program's dependencies and their version number.
